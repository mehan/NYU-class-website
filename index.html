          Tuesdays and Thursdays, 12:30-1:45pm</br>

          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>In this course you'll learn the basics of web design, learn how the internet works and build your first website from scratch. We'll be touching on topics like user experience design, visual design, image editing, animation and the history of communications technologies.</p>
          <p>The primary tools we'll be using in this course are HTML (for laying out web pages) and CSS (for styling web pages). Both are open standards that are free to use. For some of the more design-heavy topics in the course, we'll be using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. All three of these applications are available as part of the Adobe Creative Suite. You can download a free 30-day trial of the Creative Suite from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe's website</a>. Should you choose to continue using these applications, special pricing is available via <a href="https://www.bookstores.nyu.edu/computer.store/software.prices.html">the NYU bookstore</a>, however, for most students, the 30-day trial should be sufficient in order to complete assignments for class.
          </p>
          <p>If at any point during the course you have questions or are in need of help, do not hesitate to reach out to Mehan or the course tutors. More information on office hours and tutoring is available <a href="#help">below</a>.</p>

          <h5>Grading</h5>
          <p>Your grade in this course will be calculated using the following rubric:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Assignments: 40%</li>
            <li>Midterm exam: 25%</li>
            <li>Final Exam: 35%</li>

          </ul>
          <h5><a name="exams">Exam Schedule</a></h5>
          <p>The final exam for this course will take place on December 17th from 12 to 2pm in room 202 of Warren Weaver Hall. The full exam schedule is <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/fall2015/Undergraduate/final_exams">available here</a>.</p>

          <h5><a name="labs">Computer Labs</a></h5>
          <p> You do not heed to own a computer in order to take this course--NYU provides you with access to OS X machines running all the required software in the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/">ITS Labs</a>. The primary lab for this course will be the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/fourth/">Fourth Street Academic Technology Center</a>, located on the second floor at 35 West 4th Street. This is where you'll find the tutors for the course, in addition to machines for your use. A full list of all ITS Labs is available <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/">here</a>.</p>

          <p><b>When working in the ITS labs, be sure to save your work to either your NYU webspace or a portable hard drive or flash drive.</b> The hard drives of the machines in the ITS labs are erased regularly and if you save your work directly to one of the ITS machines, you may not be able to retrieve it.</p>

          <p>If you prefer to work on your own machine, please see the <a href="#tools">tools</a> section below for information on required software.</p>

          <h5><a name="help">Help</a></h5>
          <p>Mehan will be holding office hours <b>every Tuesday from 11:30am to 12:30pm</b> (i.e. the hour before class) in room 424 of <a href="https://www.cims.nyu.edu/dd16/Location/directions.html">Warren Weaver Hall</a>. The course tutors can be found at the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/fourth/">Fourth Street Academic Technology Center</a> (35 West 4th Street); <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall15/CSCI-UA.0004-003/common-syllabus/">the schedule for the course tutors is available here</a>. Additional support is also available via the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/students/undergraduates/academic-services/undergraduate-advisement/academic-resource-center/tutoring-and-learning.html">University Learning Center</a>.</p>


          <h5><a name="tools">Tools</a></h5>
          <ul>
          <li><a href="http://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6">NYU i6 Account</a>: In addition to your NYU NetID, you'll be using something called an i6 account in order to access NYU's servers. You will be automatically granted an i6 account upon registering for this class. If you run into any problems while using your i6 account, <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/faq">take a look at this FAQ</a>, which answers the most common questions that students encounter. If your question isn't answered on that page, please contact either Mehan or one of the tutors. <b>If you need to reset your i6 password, <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/webapps/content/systems/resources/i6/resetpassword">visit this link</a></b>.</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe Creative Suite</a>: This suite of software contains Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, all of which we'll be using in this course. You can obtain a free 30-day trial from Adobe's website; special one-year subscription pricing is also available via <a href="https://www.bookstores.nyu.edu/computer.store/software.prices.html">the NYU bookstore</a>.</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>: Sublime Text is a text editor that you can use to edit HTML, CSS and just about anything else that consists of plain text. It has a number of powerful features that will make writing HTML and CSS easier. Free and paid versions are available on their site for OS X, Linux and Windows--for the purposes of this course, the free version should suffice.</li>
          <li>Fetch: Fetch is an OS X FTP utility we'll be using to connect to NYU's servers and upload our files. You can download a free copy of Fetch <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/life/resources-and-services/information-technology/getting-started/software.html">by visiting this page</a> (note: you will need to login with your NYU NetID and password). Once you download and extract the .zip file, you'll find both a copy of Fetch as well as an .rtf file. The .rtf file contains the serial number you'll need to redeem your free copy of Fetch.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5><a name="books">Books</a></h5>
          <p>We'll be using the following two books in this course:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118008189.html">HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</a> (required)</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.peachpit.com/store/photoshop-cc-visual-quickstart-guide-2014-release-9780133980462">Photoshop CC: Visual Quickstart Guide</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The first book, <em>HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites</em> is required for the course and we'll be referencing it often. The second book is purely optional--you may choose to use it if you need extra help with or want to delve deeper into Photoshop, though there are plenty of free resources available for learning Photoshop online as well. Both books are available via the NYU libraries and bookstore as well as Amazon, etc.</p>
